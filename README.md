# Windows System Info Utility

This repository provides a collection of C++ functions for retrieving various system information on a Windows machine. These functions allow you to access details about the user's environment, including system hardware, software, and configuration.

## Features

- **GetUserName**: Retrieves the current logged-in user's username.
- **GetComputerName**: Retrieves the name of the computer.
- **GetWindowsProductKey**: Retrieves the Windows product key from the system registry.
- **GetMACAddress**: Retrieves the MAC address of the machine's network adapter.
- **GetUUIDAddress**: Retrieves the unique system UUID.
- **GetCPU**: Retrieves details about the CPU, such as manufacturer, model, and clock speed.
- **GetGPUName**: Retrieves the name of the system's graphics card.
- **GetTotalSystemRAM**: Retrieves the total system RAM.
- **GetWindowsVersion**: Retrieves the version and edition of the installed Windows operating system.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later.
- **Compiler**: A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., MSVC, MinGW).

## Usage

To use this project, select the desired function from the repository and ensure the necessary libraries and headers are included in your C++ project.

### Steps to Use:

1. **Select a Function**: Choose the function you want to use (e.g., `GetCPU()`).
2. **Create a New File**: Create a new C++ file in your project and paste the function code into it.
3. **Include Headers**: Ensure you include the necessary libraries and headers as required by the function (e.g., `<iostream>`, `<windows.h>`, etc.).
4. **Compile Your Code**: Compile your C++ code using your preferred compiler (e.g., MSVC or MinGW).
5. **Run the Executable**: Execute the compiled program to retrieve the system information.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the functions in your program:

```cpp
#include "SystemInfo.h"

int main() {
    std::cout << "User Name: " << GetUserName() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Computer Name: " << GetComputerName() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Windows Version: " << GetWindowsVersion() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Total RAM: " << GetTotalSystemRAM() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Expected Output

Assuming the system is configured as follows:

- **User Name**: JohnDoe
- **Computer Name**: DESKTOP-ABC1234
- **Windows Version**: Windows 10 Pro
- **Total RAM**: 16 GB

The output of the program would look something like this:

```bash
User Name: JohnDoe
Computer Name: DESKTOP-ABC1234
Windows Version: Windows 10 Pro - 20H2
Total RAM: 16 GB
```
